# PlayCanvas Outline Components

You can use this component to outline your models just like [PlayCanvas Editor](https://playcanvas.com). 
This code right from there, implemented and updated to use as standalone component.

# Instruction

Upload file **outline.js** to your assets. Then add script component to entity you want to outline and choose uploaded script.
Now you can config it for yourself.
